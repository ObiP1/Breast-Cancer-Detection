# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The program initally implements the use of Gradient Boosting & displays which features are most important or have the most effect on whether or not an individual has Breast Cancer on a model. The code also implements Machine Learning with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network to detect Breast Cancer. Tensorflow is also incorporated in the project as well. Sci-kit libraries' Breast Cancer dataset was used to accomplish this project.

Step 1) The first step is importing the necessary libaries we need in order to start & ultimately finish off this project.
