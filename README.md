# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The program initally implements the use of Gradient Boosting & displays which features are most important or have the most effect on whether or not an individual has Breast Cancer on a model. The code also implements Machine Learning with the use of a Convolutional Neural Network to detect Breast Cancer. Tensorflow is also incorporated in the project as well. Sci-kit libraries' Breast Cancer dataset was used to accomplish this project.

**Step 1)** 

The first step is importing the necessary libaries we need.

**STEP 2)**

Load the breast Cancer dataset from the SciKit library.

**STEP 3)**

Use Gradient Boosting and train your data to visualaze the effectiveness of it on the dataset.

**STEP 4)**

Plot the dataset's most important features and view which features have the greatest impact when it comes to Breast Cancer.
